        "I added some more features, because who could ever be content with a simple app that just works? I added a Google DataStore to sync your data with. This also enabled me to have extra hardware that could update when the last time you did something was. Specifically, I got a handful of Amazon Dash buttons, hijacked them so they don’t actually buy anything from Amazon, and had a Raspberry Pi listening for button presses. A specific Dash would be paired with an item being tracked and would updated it then. This way, you don’t even need to open the app to keep track of things.",

That’ll change eventually, it’s just every time I think about it, I’d rather go spend that $100 on food or more food. Which I then do. But I also need to patch the code up; this was my first iOS/Swift project and I now know how terribly I made things, so I actually want to completely redo it.
