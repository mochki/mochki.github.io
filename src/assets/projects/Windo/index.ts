        "I know the above transcript was nothing unique. Group projects everywhere follow this pattern where we spend a large portion of time just coordinating schedule or trying to figure out how everyone else’s schedules. It’s a waste of time, it’s awful, it’s the twenty-first century and we can do better. Okay we have Doodle, which is needlessly extra, and when2meet, which is ugly. So we decided to tackle a problem that was actually kind of solved but we hated all working implementations of it.",
        "Our idea was an app on all platforms that you can SSO using Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. This would make it’s initial use extremely easy and user friendly. One person makes the event from possible days and sends it to everyone in the group. Everyone in the group just puts in their available times and when that is done, the app itself picks a time that works for everyone. No more voting, no discussion, and for crying out loud, no more asking about my Wednesday class-work schedule for the 5th time.",
        "We entered this into an app design competition at BYU back in 2016. We got 2nd place! In tandem with the design, we were trying to make the app a reality. It wasn’t required for the competition so that probably burnt a lot of our motivation there. We never finished it mainly because we all graduated and the number of group projects we were all in suddenly dipped to around 0.",
        "If you like, you can check out the source code & the sketch file for the design. There is both the server code and iOS code if you so wished to continue the project. Both parts are probably around 40% done. It was a ton of fun and I wish I had this when I was in school.",
