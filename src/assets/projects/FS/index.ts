        "FamilySearch basically has a single, open source, universal family tree. Everything they do is free. You can create a free account and just start making your family tree. Any dead relative you make becomes public data, while living people data remains private. The goal is to connect your personal tree to existing data so everything is a collaborative effort. If you’re like me, you have an aunt that has done everything already for you.",
        "Then there are around 8000 other features, from smart suggestions to build your tree to an almost gamified indexing program. I encourage everyone to check it out.",
        "I started working there as an intern in January of 2018. They bumped me to a ‘Student Engineer’ when my internship ended.",
        "While there, I worked on an internal catalog of shared web components. They were huge on this and were officially using Polymer to make these components.",
        "Their CI pipeline was pretty robust and I consequently learned a lot of devOps while I was there just from contact. I’m no pro but it was definitely a valuable experience.",
