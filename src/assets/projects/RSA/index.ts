        "I took a discrete mathematics class in college where the teacher insisted we did everything in Emacs Lisp. Needless to say, 80% of that class was spent learning/hating/deciphering Emacs Lisp. I have no fond feelings toward this language but I did some interesting things in it.",
        "For my final project, I implemented RSA. It was effectively complete and secure. We could have used it to send messages to each other, except… it would have to be limited to 3 character messages. I quickly hit the integer max for anything bigger and I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to include a big integer library. So I called it good and turned that in.",
        "About a year later, this was still bugging me. Yes, I had implemented RSA in all it’s glory but it wasn’t complete. I had some downtime, so I decided to implement it in JS as functionally as possible. This time, I got it working and my soul has finally been put to rest. You can check out the source code! Also, the source code/write-up for the E-Lisp version is included below.",
