        "Sahara Dev was a company I did my college internship at during the summer months of 2017. It was basically a Dev Shop were we made deals with clients to make their digital products (backend, frontend, design). They initially tried to get me to do Ruby on Rails work (I did do like an entire dashboard) until one day I was reminiscing about how easy and fun frontend JS was and they flipped saying, “We need front end guys! Do you want to do frontend work??” Yes. I very much did not want to live on the Rails. So that’s were I started doing React projects for some cool clients.",
        "M and I were the two main React guys from then on and we worked on a number of projects together. Screenshots from a lot of my/our work there is included here.",
        "Eventually, the sales bros got so good at making deals that we were way overbooked. We were working on 3 projects at the same time and trying to hit deadlines that were way too close. They actually made me the lead on one of the projects, of which we completely missed the deadline for. I could use a weak defense like, “I’m just an intern and I don’t know what I’m doing.” or “I’m lazy and bad at what I do.” but I won’t. The real reason was that these sales bros would overpromise the timescale and undercut the prices. Our clients expected something insane and the developers just had to do it. They never consulted the devs on estimated time & resources to complete a project. I’m not really bitter, I’m just hoping one of the sales bros from that time reads this and realizes the errors of his way.",

        "Most of these projects/clients continued on after I left Sahara. Consequently, I can’t take all credit for what’s become of the site, but I can also be relieved of any and all bugs you may find, since I write immaculate code. Just kidding, probably, sadly.",
        "Neighbor, used to be called Neiybor, is simply the AirBnB of storage. Moving on. Pritchett Bridal: we finished in about a week and then we never saw it go online. Somehow, magically, it’s up now and it’s changed a bit. The1Million was an app my team of 4-7 (depending on if you include an intern, a sales bro, & PM) completed in the span of 24 hours. We had this challenge day called ‘App Day’ where different teams worked 24 hours on an app to complete it and win prizes at the end. Needless to say, we won that competition. The idea was simple, get 1 million people to pledge 1 dollar a month to a charity. If they could reach that goal, they would be donating $1 million to a charity every month.",
        "Sahara was just the home site for the company I worked for. They put a frail little intern on the project with one of the founders to finish the site. We did a dang good job too and if anything bad happened to the company, it wasn’t because of the website.",
        "Finally, BugClub was an idea to take all those subscription boxes and business model, but cater it to fly-fishermen. I didn’t think it was going anywhere, but we were pressured to finish the site, which we did in probably 2 weeks. (The designs were horrible and a pain and I can say that now without feeling bad.) Anyways, it’s obviously not up on the internet so I screenshot what I had and put it on Imgur.",
        "I should probably note that while their site at this current time is still up, the company did go bankrupt. It was a lot of fun while it lasted though!",
