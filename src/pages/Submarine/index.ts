        "Because we used brushless motors, we also needed ESCs to provide simulated 3-phase power to each motor. The ESCs can provide forward and reverse throttle to the motors when given a 5% to 10% duty cycle signal. Anything in between 5-10% corresponded to a partial forward or partial reverse. We used the Arduino to provide the needed duty cycle.",
        "To calibrate these ESC you start by having the ESC plugged into the Arduino, but not the battery that drives the motors. You know the ESC is ready to be calibrated if it is blinking orange. (A solid Orange light means that the Arduino is sitting at 90 or stop and is ready to receive signals to drive the motors.) Once the battery is connected then send 180 (or whatever you want full forward to be). You will hear some beeps then it will start flashing red. Flashing red means it is waiting for full reverse, so send 0. It will be a few times then flash red. Send 90. It will beep a couple more times. Now the ESC is calibrated. When the motor is running you can tell by the blinking on the ESC what speed it is trying to move the motor. A green blinking light means it is set to a forward spin. Red blinking means set to a reverse spin. The speed of the blink correlates to the speed of the spin.",

        "We used a servo library that sent a discrete value (ranging from 0 to 180) to the ESC’s. It listened to any serial communications from the raspberry pi as to what signals to send to which ESC. In the code we used a letter received on the serial port to correlate to a motor and its speed. For example, receiving an “A” sets the Front Left motor to forward.. Also, on boot, the Arduino would properly calibrate the ESC’s. This is done by connecting the battery and clicking reset on the Arduino at the same time.",

This server serves a simple website written in ReactJS that the user will receive the camera feed through and can send signals (using Socket.IO) to control the submarine. When the Pi gets these signals it sends the appropriate data to the Arduino.",
        "To replicate and run this project, make sure to install Node.js onto your Raspberry Pi. For convenience, we also installed yarn. Next, clone the repository. Open your terminal and change into that directory. We should be able to get it running without any further configurations. Run ‘yarn install’ then ‘yarn build’ and then ‘yarn start:prod’. That will install the dependencies we need, build that project for production and serve the production version.",

        "One thing to note is that there are two dependencies/configurations that only compile on the Pi and when it is connected to the camera and Arduino - so it won’t build/run properly on any other machine. These have to do with video encoding (from the webcam and it being mounted at /dev/video0) and trying to connect to the arduino (by default mounted at /dev/ttyACM0).",
        "We only tested connecting and running between the Pi and a Mac. By default, the peer-to-peer connection mounts the pi at ‘sub.local’. Thus we can ssh onto the Pi with the following command: ‘ssh pi@sub.local’. Once the server is running, it will say that it is accessible at either port 3000 or port 3001. This means that we can access the website on our Mac by entering the url ‘sub.local:3001’. We have no idea how this would work with a Linux or Windows machine, but we would love to learn about it if you manage to do so.",

For short use, it wasn’t a problem, but when used for more than a few minutes, the batteries and ESCs began to really heat up and had no way of cooling down. We suggest that a thermal management system also be implemented to provide some sort of heat sink for the batteries and ESCs. Otherwise the use of the submarine is limited to a few minutes at best.",
