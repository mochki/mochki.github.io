        "So I manually go to the manga’s page (One Piece, for example) and I check the page source and I copy the html for the table that has all the links to all the chapters. Throw that into vscode, use some regex to just get the last part of the chapter links. That goes into chapterSeed.js (in chunks of 10-12). Copy the base URL into getting.js.",
        "So puppeteer is spinning up a new tab for each link. Since Chrome’s kind of a memory hog, that’s why I have sections of chapters. Once that section is done, we free up the memory, close the chromium instance and move onto the next section. I needed to do this because just closing tabs themselves was not freeing up any memory and I couldn’t figure out why. The sections themselves are all asynchronous. The page loads, we give it a 10 second delay because kissmanga throws a 5 second anti-DDOS check. Then we grab the imageList that kissmanga saves as a global variable and is an array with all the links to the images of that chapter. So I use axios to download them and fs to save them. Simple enough.",
        "And that’s about it. Kissmanga does have a CAPTCHA thing that fires if you hit their servers too much- so I just had to VPN after my downloads weren’t working after a while. This will tell you if a chapter fails or if certain images on a chapter fails.",
        "Theoretically, this works with any Manga on Kissmanga so feel free to use it. It was kind of a weekend project though so if it breaks or kissmanga changes anything, sorry.",
